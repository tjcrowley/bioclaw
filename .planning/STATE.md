# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-03)

**Core value:** A Biopunk Labs researcher can ask a plain-language question about a single-cell dataset and get back a QC'd, annotated, interpreted answer without writing a scanpy script by hand.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Ingest + QC Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Ingest + QC Pipeline)
Plan: 3 of 5 in current phase
Status: Executing — Wave 1 (01-02, 01-03 complete; 01-04 in parallel, may still be executing)
Last activity: 2026-09-04 — Executed 01-03-PLAN.md (QC module: QCConfig, metrics, filtering, audit log)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 40%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases, dependency-driven bottom-up order (ingest/QC → analysis → agent wiring → bio-FM annotation → perturbation+VCC → NL Q&A capstone), following research/SUMMARY.md's suggested structure directly.
- 2026-09-03: Elliot Roth confirmed — single-cell wedge matches Biopunk Labs' real pain point; bio-FM hosting is self-hosted by default with a hosted-inference option kept in the architecture; first dataset is public (`cellxgene-census`/VCC); VCC benchmark scope is the public task format/metrics, not the live leaderboard. All four now reflected in PROJECT.md Validated requirements and Key Decisions.
- [Phase 01-ingest-qc-pipeline]: 01-02: Added pythonpath=["."] to pytest config so ingest.* modules are importable by tests (blocking issue found while writing loader tests)
- [Phase 01-ingest-qc-pipeline]: 01-03: Filled NaN QC values (mito%, doublet score/flag) for all-zero cells with 0/0.0/False rather than propagating nulls, since QC-01 requires all five columns non-null for every cell
- [Phase 01-ingest-qc-pipeline]: 01-03: Scrublet n_prin_comps default (30) crashes on small AnnData inputs (PCA bound depends on Scrublet's internal HVG selection, not adata.n_vars) — added a shrink-and-retry loop instead of a fixed smaller constant

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (Bio-FM annotation): scGPT/Geneformer VRAM requirements are LOW confidence per research — verify against current model cards before implementation. Self-hosted-by-default decision (confirmed 2026-09-03) makes this sizing question load-bearing for Phase 4 planning, not just a nice-to-know.
- Phase 5 (Perturbation + VCC): GEARS/cell-gears environment isolation is MEDIUM confidence and version-sensitive (pinned older PyTorch Geometric stack). VCC scope question is now resolved (task format/metrics only, confirmed 2026-09-03) — no longer a blocker.
- Phase 6 (NL Q&A): no established reference pattern for hallucination-mitigation (claim traceability, confidence surfacing) at this agent+scientific-tool combination — flagged as highest-risk phase in research.
- Project-wide validation with Elliot Roth: resolved 2026-09-03 (see Decisions above). Remaining open item (non-blocking): check overlap with Cardiac Base Editor / FDT-BioTech on cardiomyocyte single-cell data as an early test dataset (CONCEPT.md).
